# AeroWise â€” AI-Powered Environmental Intelligence for Urban Real Estate

**AeroWise** is a design project developed to integrate environmental intelligence into real estate decision-making.  

In most cities, property evaluations focus on price, location, and amenities. However, ecological indicators such as air quality and green cover are often overlooked, despite their significant impact on public health, sustainability, and long-term property value.  

This project addresses this gap by combining real-time and historical environmental data with geospatial analysis and machine learning. The result is a dashboard that empowers citizens, investors, and urban planners to make informed, sustainability-oriented decisions.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a web-based dashboard that visualizes air quality and green cover data.  
- Implement machine learning models to forecast Air Quality Index (AQI) trends.  
- Design a "green score" metric to evaluate ecological health at plot or neighborhood levels.  
- Provide recommendations for environmentally sustainable real estate development.

## Key Features

### Geospatial Visualization
- Interactive map displaying pollution (AQI) and vegetation (NDVI) data.  
- Ability to zoom into specific plots, districts, or regions.  
- Layer toggles for comparing multiple environmental indicators.  

### Air Quality Forecasting
- AQI predictions using Facebook Prophet and LSTM neural networks.  
- Incorporates historical data and seasonal variations.  

### Green Score Calculator
- Combines AQI, NDVI, and optionally noise/traffic data.  
- Produces a composite ecological health score for a location.  

### Environment-Aware Recommendations
- Suggests plots or neighborhoods with better environmental profiles.  
- Highlights sustainable zones for residential or commercial development.

## Impact and Relevance

As urbanization accelerates, environmental factors are often neglected in planning and investment decisions. AeroWise demonstrates how AI and geospatial intelligence can support:  

- Smarter property investment choices based on ecological indicators.  
- Comparison of neighborhoods beyond cost and amenities.  
- Urban planning aligned with health, sustainability, and livability.  

By merging artificial intelligence, geospatial analytics, and environmental science, this project showcases a data-driven approach to building healthier and more sustainable cities.
